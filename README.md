# The-Traffic-Signal-Controller
This project involves designing a synchronous counter-based traffic signal controller, where the counter represents four states controlling traffic lights for main and side streets. The system operates based on three input variables (vehicle sensor, long timer, and short timer), and state transitions occur based on specific conditions, ensuring proper traffic light sequencing.
